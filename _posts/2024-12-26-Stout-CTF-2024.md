“A thought process /yapping writeup instead of technical writeup”
Focusing on CTF beginners to tell the story about how I solve
Better to read from the top like a story book because I’m yapping.

## Getting Started

---

### Rules
**Description:**<br>
Can you find the hidden flag in the Rules?

> F12 (inspect element) is strong with this one! You got this :)

> Lots of struggles on this one. You are not submitting anything that is VISIBLE on the Rules Page! Use the tools you have to find HIDDEN values inside the page! You are submitting a flag that says STOUTCTF{something goes here} It is in plaintext, but is hidden on the page! 
> Hint Hint -> Main, Container, Container <- Hint Hint

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{0zpWOx4oFcOTK2hXSsKetlTuhwcJyllV}

On the ctfd platform, https://ctf.oplabs.us/ navigate to rules https://ctf.oplabs.us/rules
Press `CTRL+U` to view page source. Scroll down a bit and you can see a comment `<!—Hidden Flag Location -->`.  Then found the flag

```html
<!-- Hidden Flag Location -->
    <div class="mt-4">
        <p style="display: none;">STOUTCTF{0zpWOx4oFcOTK2hXSsKetlTuhwcJyllV}</p>
    </div>
```

### Discord
**Description:**<br>
Please join the discord and find the flag!

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{9Ka9jJghCbywhriTgfcHKvVXyUmChd0w}

In the announcement via whatsapp, there are [discord link](https://discord.com/invite/kwP74sWvJJ).<br>
Alternatively, in the rules page, `https://ctf.oplabs.us/rules` scroll to bottom and click Join Our Discord button

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/discord.png" alt="">

On the left pane there are multiple discord channel. Go to `#roles` and react to the message to get you discord role. 

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/discord1.png" alt="">

Looking at the left pane again, there should be a channel called `#discord-flag` and got the flag there.

### Feedback
**Description:**<br>
Thank you so much for competing in our first ever Capture the Flag Competition! We appreciate you filling out this form, its the only way we can know how we did and improve for the future!<br>
`https://dyno.gg/form/a580e942`

> You will get a new role in Discord to gain access to a new channel to get the flag!

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{Thanks_For_Playing_Stout's_First_CTF}

Fill in the dyno.gg form. When ur done go to your discord and there will be `#feedback-flag` channel. There is flag there

*Extra feedback from me*
I like the forensic challenge!

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/feedback.png" alt="">

I do a little bit of flag hoarding as the rules didn’t mention about it. So u might notice I got many flag at the end :P (Sorry h4rmony but you are one of the Intigriti so I want to compete)

### Based

**Description:**<br>
This challenge is Based

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{hS5DTJc12bDy7sqJoH7qQs7dXrE4Ysd7}

The most common encoding is XOR and base64. Every CTF got base64 so if you are active in CTFs you might identify that this is a base64 encoding. There are many tools but I used [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/) and [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode everything. For this just open cyberchef not dcode because in dcode you need to type base64 and redirect to another page, but for cyberchef just drag from the favourites panel on the left so its faster (even for a little faster I still called it time efficiency because I got another CTF to play). Drag “From Base64” and paste the ciphertext at the input

### V

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{QfT8PE2rHjxRkbpHmC6OJp14cW6xHy7N}

V.txt
```text
Use the Giovan alphabet provided to you ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Can you solve the great GIOVAN mystery?

YBCPTPZN{EaT8CK2zVexEqjdCmP6URd14xW6kNg7B}
```

Here there are two ways to past the first step in cryptography, which is identifying the cipher used to encode the plaintext or flag.
1.	Take a look at the challenge title and description. For this example, is V. You can use ChatGPT to get the cipher list that start with V.
2.	Make some research. The challenge txt file, V.txt mentioned about Giovan. Just google it.<br>
    <img src="/assets/images/stout24/v.png" alt="">

Go to [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/) and search viginere (or click the dcode link if you are googling). Vigenere cipher used KEY/PASSWORD to decode your ciphertext. In dcode, you can bruteforce it. But looking at the V.txt file again, the word GIOVAN is uppercased. So we can assume it was the key.

### Jean
**Description:**<br>
Have you worn some lately?

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{QFT8PE2RHJXRKBPHMC6OJP14CW6XHY7N}

This challenge  a bit tricky for beginners. I did mentioned that I only use cyberchef and dcode to decode my ciphertext. But what if I can’t decode it?
First we need to identify our cipher text. [Dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) can identify it for us

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/jean.png" alt="">

If there are many black square on the left, you are good to go. If some challenge ciphertext got no black square, then GGs. For this fortunately we get many black square.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/jean1.png" alt="">

If there are no key, I always bruteforce it. But this time, no flag in the output. Damn.
So need some researching. Search the cipher decoder. Just click on each of them and try all tools. 
You will eventually went into [this one](https://earthsciweb.org/js/bio/dna-writer/). 

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/jean2.png" alt="">

I tried here and got the flag.

### Hidden Waveforms
**Description:**<br>
Hidden in the waves lies a secret. Can you find it?

> There are many ways to hide information in audio, and many tools, but sometimes Occam’s razor applies. Think: STEganoGraphy

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{U6OvEbbs1eNX6UcG3hGIZaaeB70cgcg7}

For this challenge we got WAV file. Every WAV file I try to view spectrogram in Sonic Visualiser (Layer  add Spectogram). There are no plaintext we can read in the spectrogram (the green one).

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/waveform1.png" alt="">

But we can see the short and long line(?) (don’t know whats it called) So I thought it was a morse code.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/waveform2.png" alt="">

But there are no flag. Notice that it show HE not HERE but I just skip this and not retry to decode it because there are nothing else.<br>
This is where I use all the tools I can think of. Tools for steganography and forensic. I tried common forensic tools like exiftool, binwalk, etc but got nothing useful. So tried to use steganoghraphy tools. There are many, like steghide, zsteg, stegseek. This 3 is mainly I use. So here I tried stegseek and got a file. I check the file type, which is ASCII text and just cat the file.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/waveform3.png" alt="">

Here can copy all of that and put in cyberchef. I fyou don’t know what this is, you can use Magic tool in cyberchef.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/waveform4.png" alt="">

Now we got a really strange looking text. The symbol consist of +, [, >, etc. Based on experience I know this is brainfuck

I always use [this link](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) because it has view memory features. Some brainfuck challenge has flag in the memory not the output. But for this one its in the output

### Nothing To See Here!
**Description:**<br>
Seriously, what are you looking at?

> What do they call the empty space between or around objects? I think that might be useful here, and its not negative, think in a document. Maybe color, or the lack of color, depends on how you see it.

> Sanity hint, there is no hex involved in this challenge ;)

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{ab6IcT8R4vNyAJNWQteBJ3Yd2VTrkVCp}

When we open the txt file, we can see nothing. Like my future. If you use VSCode, you can see there’s something.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/nothing1.png" alt="">

For this challenge, use whitespace decoder

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/nothing2.png" alt="">

We got a another ciphertext. “Everything that ends with ‘=’ is base64”. Remember this until you gone from this world. Go to cyberchef to decode the base64.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/nothing3.png" alt="">

It say there is nothing here but you cant fool ‘you’ twice! Its not me because I did not get fooled. Go to whitespace decoder again and got the flag.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/nothing4.png" alt="">

### Custom Cipher
**Description:**<br>
Your scripting cant break my encoding!<br><br>

VWRXWFWI{Vr3J8NJks4Tn58PjDv3IPNc9VueGFwlu}

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{So3G8KGhp4Qk58MgAs3FMKz9SrbDCtir}

Here I use cyberchef’s rot13 bruteforce. Then CTRL F to get the flag. How do I know it’s a rotation? Because the ciphertext VWRXWFWI when compared to STOUTCTF got many related things. S to V is 3 alphabet. T to W is also 3 alphabet. So need to apply to all, then we use ROT.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/custom1.png" alt="">

### 13RottenTeRmites

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{qKp1MOJMDaJUIJ5KybLrcfZOFQ3IN1j2}

This challenge is evil. I thought the final output is just the flag string but its in the gibberish. I play around in cyberchef for hours and CTRL+F and got the flag finally. I hope theres no challenge similar to this in the future

### 7 Bit Flow
**Description:**<br>
Computers see images much differently than we do. Can you see the bigger picture?

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{7jDcMSX5lqCCM6wxr7ijiTSUXRz0LiiU}

This challenge is creative. On the top left corner you can see something

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/bit1.png" alt="">

Its mostly red. This challenge made me read a whole [research paper](https://ijcsmc.com/docs/papers/May2014/V3I5201499a94.pdf) because I find something related to 7bit and cryptography.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/bit2.png" alt="">

After hours of depression , I play around with [stegsolve](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools/blob/master/stegsolve/install) because the tools can extract bit layer (data extract feature)

Check all the 7 bit boxes cant get the flag. Notice the redness in the picture? Just tick the 7th red box and got the flag bruh.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/bit3.png" alt="">

### Fat Fingers
**Description:**<br>
I seem to have fatfingered the file in transit... I should do more cardio!

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{dtTC9pa0JgySqCpIJbLTMGL3j7XaTwDT}

First of all I always compare the flag format with the ciphertext and make deduction. For this challenge the flag is at the left key on qwerty keyboard. If you know what im talking about. Sorry for bad English. Map it manually and got it.

### Huffman
**Description:**<br>
Trees are very pretty. I like trees!

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{A0LZTvEW23NcbeKk8JyWJ8W0b6Mx7p6N}

This one I used chatgpt 100% because I’m noob at cryptography. ChatGPT is a tool tho so don’t shy shy to use it.

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

### Abandoned Airwaves
**Description:**<br>
You can use the radio signals to do some fascinating things from communication to tracking moving objects and much much more. The structures built to harness these signals for these things are quite incredible and sometimes awe inspiring. They are all over the world too, from cell towers to satellite uplinks. And while some connect to the internet, the basic principles of all of it are completely independent of the internet. Just pure math and physics. Radio communication is quite something isn't it?

Can you find the name of the station this image was taken at?

### Last Known Location
**Description:**<br>
Alex Carter (not a real person), a social media personality known for his travel blog content was recently reported missing. He is known for his daily updates to his travel social media accounts and his family became worried when Alex hadn’t posted for three days. We know that Alex loves exploring a mix of urban enviornments and nature. He especially loves visiting Asian countries since he did study abroad there in College and loves the food. Recently, he has been exploring less-touristy areas of hot tourist locations.

The last thing he posted was this image with the caption: "Every street has a story. Can you guess where I am? Heading to this awesome little café I stumbled across. I’ll check in later!"

We need you to figure out where he was before he disappeared. Good luck.

### The Echos

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{fZtPEj720e1OKFrQPqouICBdgVAtD14N}

When opening the wireshark file. We can see strings in every packet. We can use tshark to extract data from wireshark via linux terminal. After understanding about the data in wireshark, I know we need to extract the data field. This solve is one liner so I apologise because it’s not so beginner friendly. But I’ll give the visualisation on why I use this command.

```bash
$ tshark -r TheEchos.pcap -Y "icmp.type == 8" -T fields -e data | cut -c 1-2 | tr -d '\n'
```

Basically, -r is we reading the file. We need the data in icmp because theres only icmp packet. If you take a look at one of the packet, there is type 8 mentioned.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/echo1.png" alt="">

Then -e data is just extracting data. Using | (pipe) command to use multiple command. Using tshark -r TheEchos.pcap -Y "icmp.type == 8" -T fields -e data we get below

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/echo2.png" alt="">

Add the cut -c 1-2 to get below.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/echo3.png" alt="">

Add tr -d '\n' to get concatenate all of them

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/echo4.png" alt="">

We know wireshark use hex. So go to cyberchef and find flag

### The Orbs of Light
**Description:**<br>
Dr. Elana Markov sat hunched over her desk, the flickering light of a small monitor casting shadows across the cluttered lab. The coordinates had come from a crumbling fragment of an old text—a discovery that many dismissed as mere legend. But Markov knew better.

She had just returned from the coordinates after finding a ominous video, her breath catching as grainy, footage filled the screen. The camera, sat motionless watched an endless, icy expanse, the snow creating a dense fog in the distance she watched and watched trying to find something, anything to give her a clue of what this was, she knew something was off.

As she watched the video over and over she realized there must be another part of the video, she must be missing something. She returned to the site and found a note hidden under piles of rubble with the same ancient cipher as before.

Hours later, she had deciphered the beginning of the hidden message within the light. It was fragmented, incomplete:

“To find the truth, follow...”

She pushed on looking everywhere for anymore clues to what this might mean. After searching high and low she discovered a hidden compartment with a cryptic note, the beginning looked familiar, the same as before, but this one was complete "To find the truth, follow... wkh ruev ri oljkw, wkhb iolfnhu lq d suhglfwdeoh sdwwhuq, wkhb zloo ohdg brx wr Wkh Hwhuqdo Qdyljdwru. Wkh sdvvzrug brx vhhn lv rue5riO1jkw"

With this, she knew what she needed to do.

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{NZO2ARCB9SKB24K5MMEVY5GYWAAJJHQG}

The zip file got password. Try to decrypt the ciphertext from the challenge description `wkh ruev ri oljkw, wkhb iolfnhu lq d suhglfwdeoh sdwwhuq, wkhb zloo ohdg brx wr Wkh Hwhuqdo Qdyljdwru. Wkh sdvvzrug brx vhhn lv rue5riO1jkw`

Interestingly, I used dcode and there are multiple encoding that we can use so thats a new thing I learned.

### Substitute Teacher
**Description:**<br>
The year is 1992, a few weeks after the fall of the Soviet Union. Amidst the chaos, a group of 45 rogue operatives known as "The Teachers" were tasked with safeguarding classified files. Their mission? To ensure these secrets stayed hidden from prying eyes. To achieve this, they devised a series of intricate steps to obscure their plans.

Your mission is to recover the hidden flag from their encrypted communication. The operatives left all the tools you need in the provided file, but they didn’t make it easy. They relied on meticulous precision, where every detail—big or small, uppercase or lowercase—could hold the key to unlocking their secrets.

Can you decipher their layers of secrecy and reveal the hidden truth?

> You are looking for 1 of each of the following: HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP. You need all 4 to solve.

> For sanity, there are 4 steps to get to the file. Then you can start looking for the flag. The flag is INSIDE the file its not hiding anywhere that you need tools to find. The 4 you need are plaintext.

> Use a tool like Cyberchef for the first couple parts of the challenge. gzip -d doesn't work for some reason. Entropy is your friend! There are 4 steps before you get a pcap file. Don't forget you have more information at your disposal, it might help to look at it ;)

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{E8YrQNB6mWaI2PGncYjBKGkyz3yl8Iec}

After the 3 hints, there are 4 step. Gunzip, base92, base45, gunzip. (This is after I understand the challenge description)<br>
And this is before I understand<br>
So I tried identifying it first.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute.png" alt="">

Here I know its base92

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute1.png" alt="">

U see the magic wand? I was like DAMN is this itt??<br>
The hint said for the first two can just use cyber chef. I tried base by base and got another magic wand. DAMNNN

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute2.png" alt="">

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute3.png" alt="">

Back to the present. Now I got a pcap file after the 4 steps.
THERE ARE 30K PACKETS BROO

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute4.png" alt="">

Lets deduce the hints and challenge description

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute5.png" alt="">

Thanks to the hints, there are four parts to find to get the flag. One in each, HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP.<br>
It mentions about uppercase and lower case. It being the key to get flag. So, one ciphertext, three key. 3 keys? Which cipher use 3 keys? Welp just read.<br>
Lastly it mentions about teacher<br>
First, CTRL+F teacher

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute6.png" alt="">

You see that? It’s a ciphertext bro. Now we are done in http.<br>
Second, ftp

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute7.png" alt="">

Just scroll and you see the one and only<br>
Third, TCP<br>
We want to prepare the colomn first. Right click the Data -> protocol reference -> Show data as text

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute8.png" alt="">

Then right click apply as column

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute9.png" alt="">

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute10.png" alt="">

Here you want to find all lowercase or all uppercase as the challenge description said about it. Then find the odd one. Looking at the scroll button theres and odd one tho

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute11.png" alt="">

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute12.png" alt="">

So now got Upper, so other one ofcourse lower<br>
Fourth, find Lower in udp

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute13.png" alt="">

Not we got all four parts. But what encryption?
Now im making my deduction

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute14.png" alt="">

After 10 minutes staring at this note, and comparing YTERTCTQ to STOUTCTF, I got like this. 

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute15.png" alt="">

Does it make sense to you? For me yes. For example, we take a look at letter Y. uppercase Y is in the same number position for S in alphabetical order. Same with other flag format. So now its confirm my deduction is correct.<br>
I manually map this and not using any script cause im a noob. Eventually, I got: <br>
STOUTCTF{E8YrQNB6mWaI2PGncYjBKGkyz3yl8Iec} <br>
Solved the hardest challenge at 4am and im still hoarding till now (im writing this writeup rn when Im doing malware challenge). Only Peyton know about this :P

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/substitute16.png" alt="">

All flag got except malware and the last web. This one is valuable. I cant let anyone know I got this flag.

I use Jetbrain dotpeek. Using Dnspy cannot see the source

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/bossman1.png" alt="">

First try to run the find the strings in dotpeek to locate the function

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/bossman2.png" alt="">

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/bossman3.png" alt="">

Looking into the code we can see that the function getTime() is the only that have some sort of encoding process.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/bossman4.png" alt="">

Create the script

```python
import base64

# Data from the decompiled getTime() function
chArray1 = ['U', '1', 'R', 'P']
chArray2 = ['V', 'V', 'R', 'D']
chArray3 = ['V', 'E', 'Z', '7']
charArray1 = "VGZSVDBsWW9nUjRWa3ZDaEdab2tS"
charArray2 = "MkFmR2ZUQ0p2SEh9"

result = []

result.extend(chArray1)
result.extend(chArray2)
result.extend(chArray3)

# Encode charArray1 to Base64 and slice it to its original length
base64_encoded_charArray1 = base64.b64encode(charArray1.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')
result.append(base64_encoded_charArray1[:len(charArray1)])

# Append charArray2 (interpreted as a UTF-8 string)
result.append(charArray2)

final_string = ''.join(result)

print(final_string)
```

Just run it and got base64. Why don’t I decode base64 in the code? I did not think of it

NodeE -> NodeF 29999 NodeE -> NodeA 82356

NodeF -> NodeC 77777 NodeF -> NodeA 33333 NodeF -> NodeD 88888 NodeF -> NodeG 88888

NodeG -> NodeA 1

Example submission: A -> B 1 B -> A 1

First of all, Im not good at malware analysis. So when there are malware challenge, I can only hope to decrypt whatever I saw in bunch of tools. Some of the tools im using is IDAPRO, any.run and Virus Total. This takes A LOT of my time as Im not good at web so im more focusing on other things.<br>
You see how many task I’ve run? Then I saw that it have a restart button. So there should be more than this. Like tripled.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/blue1.png" alt="">

All of the file that I can extract I gave to ChatGPT hoping there is flag plaintext. But nope

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/blue2.png" alt="">

AI summary also doesn’t yield anything useful.<br>
So for like 1 day and half, I cant get anything in any.run. or im too noob. Pls give me tips @John <br>
I did use IDAPro. But the thing is, the malware is obfuscated. The only thing I know that unobfuscate is just UPX. So, I tried UPX -d and go to IDApro again. But it still says its obfuscated. I don’t remember where it said that maybe chatgpt because in Chatgpt there is Malware Analysis malware, but I use it for one hour only and its useless. So, the string in IDApro is too many and I’m too noob at searching from thousands of no name functions.<br>
Then after I got substitute teacher’s flag, and flag hoarding it (sorry h4rmony) I focused on malware again. I installed new VM and tried to run in it, but it kept crashing. You know how long I tried? Freaking 10 hours. But its okay, in the meantime, I do my writeup while installing and uninstalling the VM and submitting flags that Im hoarding. Then after finished doing my writeup and submitting flags (except the last web chall I cant get it).<br>
Same timestamp as submitting flag and doing writeup, and while trying to “failed dynamic” analysis of the malware, I export virustotal analysis and feed to chatgpt (expand all the report and screenshotting) multiple times I got something. When screenshotting behaviour tab, under Registry keys set there are base64 encoding that give flag OMG

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/blue3.png" alt="">

ChatGPT decoded it but its gone. So here is the cyberchef screenshot

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/blue4.png" alt="">

That’s all from me, just a noob guy using chatgpt if I don’t know anything about it.
Imma do the last web challenge now and I’ll update if I get it. Don’t know if I can cause the whole day im looking at the screen.
