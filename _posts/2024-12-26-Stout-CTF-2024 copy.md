## Getting Started

---

### Rules
**Description:**<br>
Can you find the hidden flag in the Rules?

> F12 (inspect element) is strong with this one! You got this :)

> Lots of struggles on this one. You are not submitting anything that is VISIBLE on the Rules Page! Use the tools you have to find HIDDEN values inside the page! You are submitting a flag that says STOUTCTF{something goes here} It is in plaintext, but is hidden on the page! 
> Hint Hint -> Main, Container, Container <- Hint Hint

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{0zpWOx4oFcOTK2hXSsKetlTuhwcJyllV}

On the ctfd platform, https://ctf.oplabs.us/ navigate to rules https://ctf.oplabs.us/rules
Press `CTRL+U` to view page source. Scroll down a bit and you can see a comment `<!—Hidden Flag Location -->`.  Then found the flag

```html
<!-- Hidden Flag Location -->
    <div class="mt-4">
        <p style="display: none;">STOUTCTF{0zpWOx4oFcOTK2hXSsKetlTuhwcJyllV}</p>
    </div>
```

Fill in the dyno.gg form. When ur done go to your discord and there will be `#feedback-flag` channel. There is flag there

*Extra feedback from me*
I like the forensic challenge!

### Based

**Description:**<br>
This challenge is Based

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{hS5DTJc12bDy7sqJoH7qQs7dXrE4Ysd7}

The most common encoding is XOR and base64. Every CTF got base64 so if you are active in CTFs you might identify that this is a base64 encoding. There are many tools but I used [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/) and [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode everything. For this just open cyberchef not dcode because in dcode you need to type base64 and redirect to another page, but for cyberchef just drag from the favourites panel on the left so its faster (even for a little faster I still called it time efficiency because I got another CTF to play). Drag “From Base64” and paste the ciphertext at the input

### V

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{QfT8PE2rHjxRkbpHmC6OJp14cW6xHy7N}

V.txt
```text
Use the Giovan alphabet provided to you ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Can you solve the great GIOVAN mystery?

YBCPTPZN{EaT8CK2zVexEqjdCmP6URd14xW6kNg7B}
```

Here there are two ways to past the first step in cryptography, which is identifying the cipher used to encode the plaintext or flag.
1.	Take a look at the challenge title and description. For this example, is V. You can use ChatGPT to get the cipher list that start with V.
2.	Make some research. The challenge txt file, V.txt mentioned about Giovan. Just google it.<br>
    <img src="/assets/images/stout24/v.png" alt="">

Go to [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/) and search viginere (or click the dcode link if you are googling). Vigenere cipher used KEY/PASSWORD to decode your ciphertext. In dcode, you can bruteforce it. But looking at the V.txt file again, the word GIOVAN is uppercased. So we can assume it was the key.

### Jean
**Description:**<br>
Have you worn some lately?

**Flag:**
STOUTCTF{QFT8PE2RHJXRKBPHMC6OJP14CW6XHY7N}

This challenge  a bit tricky for beginners. I did mentioned that I only use cyberchef and dcode to decode my ciphertext. But what if I can’t decode it?
First we need to identify our cipher text. [Dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) can identify it for us

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/jean.png" alt="">

If there are many black square on the left, you are good to go. If some challenge ciphertext got no black square, then GGs. For this fortunately we get many black square.

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/jean1.png" alt="">

If there are no key, I always bruteforce it. But this time, no flag in the output. Damn.
So need some researching. Search the cipher decoder. Just click on each of them and try all tools. 
You will eventually went into [this one](https://earthsciweb.org/js/bio/dna-writer/). 

<img src="/assets/images/stout24/jean2.png" alt="">

I tried here and got the flag.

### The Orbs of Light
**Description:**<br>
Dr. Elana Markov sat hunched over her desk, the flickering light of a small monitor casting shadows across the cluttered lab. The coordinates had come from a crumbling fragment of an old text—a discovery that many dismissed as mere legend. But Markov knew better.

She had just returned from the coordinates after finding a ominous video, her breath catching as grainy, footage filled the screen. The camera, sat motionless watched an endless, icy expanse, the snow creating a dense fog in the distance she watched and watched trying to find something, anything to give her a clue of what this was, she knew something was off.

As she watched the video over and over she realized there must be another part of the video, she must be missing something. She returned to the site and found a note hidden under piles of rubble with the same ancient cipher as before.

Hours later, she had deciphered the beginning of the hidden message within the light. It was fragmented, incomplete:

“To find the truth, follow...”

She pushed on looking everywhere for anymore clues to what this might mean. After searching high and low she discovered a hidden compartment with a cryptic note, the beginning looked familiar, the same as before, but this one was complete "To find the truth, follow... wkh ruev ri oljkw, wkhb iolfnhu lq d suhglfwdeoh sdwwhuq, wkhb zloo ohdg brx wr Wkh Hwhuqdo Qdyljdwru. Wkh sdvvzrug brx vhhn lv rue5riO1jkw"

With this, she knew what she needed to do.

### Substitute Teacher
**Description:**<br>
The year is 1992, a few weeks after the fall of the Soviet Union. Amidst the chaos, a group of 45 rogue operatives known as "The Teachers" were tasked with safeguarding classified files. Their mission? To ensure these secrets stayed hidden from prying eyes. To achieve this, they devised a series of intricate steps to obscure their plans.

Your mission is to recover the hidden flag from their encrypted communication. The operatives left all the tools you need in the provided file, but they didn’t make it easy. They relied on meticulous precision, where every detail—big or small, uppercase or lowercase—could hold the key to unlocking their secrets.

Can you decipher their layers of secrecy and reveal the hidden truth?

> You are looking for 1 of each of the following: HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP. You need all 4 to solve.

> For sanity, there are 4 steps to get to the file. Then you can start looking for the flag. The flag is INSIDE the file its not hiding anywhere that you need tools to find. The 4 you need are plaintext.

> Use a tool like Cyberchef for the first couple parts of the challenge. gzip -d doesn't work for some reason. Entropy is your friend! There are 4 steps before you get a pcap file. Don't forget you have more information at your disposal, it might help to look at it ;)

### Abandoned Airwaves
**Description:**<br>
You can use the radio signals to do some fascinating things from communication to tracking moving objects and much much more. The structures built to harness these signals for these things are quite incredible and sometimes awe inspiring. They are all over the world too, from cell towers to satellite uplinks. And while some connect to the internet, the basic principles of all of it are completely independent of the internet. Just pure math and physics. Radio communication is quite something isn't it?

Can you find the name of the station this image was taken at?

### Last Known Location
**Description:**<br>
Alex Carter (not a real person), a social media personality known for his travel blog content was recently reported missing. He is known for his daily updates to his travel social media accounts and his family became worried when Alex hadn’t posted for three days. We know that Alex loves exploring a mix of urban enviornments and nature. He especially loves visiting Asian countries since he did study abroad there in College and loves the food. Recently, he has been exploring less-touristy areas of hot tourist locations.

The last thing he posted was this image with the caption: "Every street has a story. Can you guess where I am? Heading to this awesome little café I stumbled across. I’ll check in later!"

We need you to figure out where he was before he disappeared. Good luck.

Flag is the exact coordinates of where the photo was taken. Coordinates are for the only google street view photo with the perspective of the picture. Format: latidude,longitude
