## Hello, I'm Haziq ’Izzuddin bin Mohd Shukri

I'm a dedicated cybersecurity student currently in my final year at [UniKL MIIT](https://miit.unikl.edu.my/), pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer System Security. With a strong foundation built through hands-on roles as a SOC Analyst Intern at ASK Pentest Sdn Bhd and as an IT Specialist at Universiti Poly-Tech Malaysia, I've immersed myself in both offensive and defensive security measures—from ethical hacking and digital forensics to incident response.

### My Journey & Passion

My academic path is fueled by a relentless curiosity and a commitment to safeguarding digital landscapes. Along the way, I’ve embraced every opportunity to learn—earning industry-recognized certifications like **CompTIA Security+** and engaging in specialized online courses on cybersecurity fundamentals and ethical hacking. 

### Competitions & Achievements

I’m proud to have tested my skills in various competitive arenas:
- **First Place** – Internal CTF UniKL MIIT 2023
- **Seventh Place** – International Battle of Hackers 2024 (Local Category)
- **Second Place** – CurtinCTF 2024
- **Fourth Place** – SherpaCTF Open Category

These experiences not only sharpened my technical abilities but also deepened my appreciation for teamwork and innovative problem-solving.

### Beyond the Classroom

In addition to my studies and internships, I serve as the **CSSC President**, where I actively contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing insights, fostering discussions, and championing a culture of continuous learning. I believe that collaboration and open dialogue are key to driving progress in our rapidly evolving field.

Feel free to connect with me on social media or drop me a message if you’d like to discuss cybersecurity trends, potential collaborations, or simply share ideas. I’m always eager to explore new challenges and opportunities in the digital realm.
